    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> \n",
    "<a href=\"https://hypeauditor.com/top-instagram/\">HypeAuditor</a> lists the top 1000 influencers by  category by country. The ranking is updated daily and takes into account quality audience and authentic engagement to control for bots and inactive accounts. For each listing the number of followers from a given country and the total number of followers are indicated. First, we scraped all listings for each category and country combination on February 2020. The number of listings for each combination varies depending on the volume of influencers in the domain. In 45 cases (0.3%) the ``followers_from_country``  column was missing because the data was unavailable on HypeAuditor. These records have been excluded from our analysis. Second, we divided both metrics by one another to derive the *purity*. That is, the percentage of influencers' followers from a given country. Third, we exclude followers whose purity is below 50%. As a result, we end up with a list of influencers (N = 5391) whose main following base is located in a single country (41% of all top influencers). Fourth, we sort the influencers by purity and pick 20 influencers for each country in our dataset. This yields a sample of 420 influencers whose mean purity is 82.2%.\n",

    "For each selected influencer we collected a list of their followers using [Phantombuster](https://phantombuster.com/automations/instagram/7085/instagram-profile-scraper) and draw a random sample of 5 followers to construct our dataset of consumers. That is, public Instagram users who followed an influencer account from our list of top 20 influencers by country we identified in step 1. Given our stratified sampling approach, we assumed that the list of consumers followed the country distribution according to the purity rates we computed earlier. Through our identification strategy, we expected to correctly classify 81.5% and 83.2% of influencers’ followers in the treatment and control group, respectively. For the control group this figure is likely even higher as the mere chance of being in a country part of the control group is higher than being in one of the countries of the treatment group. Note that we choose for 5 consumers for each influencer account because of the curse of dimensionality which required us to limit the sample size to be able to analyze high-dimensional unstructured data across multiple years."

Next, we used [Instagram Scraper](https://github.com/arc298/instagram-scraper), a command-line application written in Python, to obtain user information, social relationship information, and photo information from aforementioned Instagram accounts. Since the photo and video files attached to each post take up a significant amount of memory, we chose to only store the media URL instead. More specifically, we run the command below to collect the post information of the latest 1000 posts of usernames in `FILE_NAME.txt` (i.e., text file that contains all artists/consumers/influencers). Although we were especially interested in the months prior and after the intervention, we choose for 1000 posts to make sure we would collect sufficient data. If influencers would post every single day, we would still have data that spans a timeframe of more than 2.5 years and thus include 12 months of data before and after the intervention while minimizing the time required for web-scraping.\n"

Next, we perform the cosine similarity operation which measures the angle between two vectors and determines whether two vectors are pointing in the same direction. More specifically, we multiply the confidence scores of pictures 1 and 2 for each image tag (e.g., for people: 0.67 x 0.74) and divide by the multiplication of the length of both vectors. Mathematically, this can be denoted as: $sim(x,y)=  (x∙y)/(||x||∙||y||)$ \n",

A larger confidence score has a larger weight and more overlapping image tags gives a higher cosine similarity score. Filling in the confidence scores above, we find a cosine similarity of `0.63` between picture 1 and 2. The diagonal contains 1s as comparing any image with itself always yields a cosine similarity of 1. In the `within_subject_similarity` function below we repeat this procedure on a larger scale, but aggregate the mean cosine similarity on a monthly level and use both image tags and categories as input sources."

    "To reduce bias of distribution overlap and different density weighting, we rebalance our data through matching non-treated users to treated ones on similar covariate values. First, we estimate a probit model of receiving treatment on the number of followers, the number of followings, the adoption speed of Instagram use, and the percentage of image posts relative to all types of media posts. Second, we compute the Mahalanobis distance for each treated and control user pair and select unique matches sequentially, in order of closeness of their Mahalanobis distances. We matched without replacement such that control units are only allowed to be used as a match once. Each treatment unit was matched with a single control unit as a higher number of matches deteriorated matching quality significantly. Third, we conduct an imbalance check before and after matching of which the results have been reported in the paper. "

    "As the number of likes is largely determined by the number of followers, we calculated the ratio between both metrics in order to control for the following size. Additionally, we investigate the effect on the comment rate (i.e., number of comments per 100 followers) and the follower growth. Since users do not see all posts of accounts they follow, we cannot tell whether each treatment and control unit saw a post or not. To overcome this limitation we ran another study in which we examined the effect of hiding video impression counts on the like rate."
