### Goodbye Likes, Hello Mental Health - How Hiding Like Counts Affects Self-Esteem and User Behavior

This repository contains supplemental material associated with my research master thesis. On a conceptual level we investigate the effect of hiding like counts on Instagram on users' posting frequency (H1), variety of visual-content (H2), like behavior (H3), and self-esteem (H4).

## Acknowledgements
In the past half a year I was supervised by Hannes Datta (TiSEM) and Niels van de Ven (TiSEM), who I would like to thank for their comments on my thesis. Furthermore, I am grateful for Microsoft for providing Azure credits which we used to study image similarity.
