# Hiding Likes on Instagram 
### Goodbye Likes, Hello Mental Health - How Hiding Like Counts Affects User Behavior and Self-Esteem

<p style="clear: both;">This repository contains supplemental material associated with my research master thesis. Specifically, the <a href="https://github.com/RoyKlaasseBos/Hiding-Instagram-Likes/blob/master/Web_Appendix_Hiding_Like_Counts_Instagram.ipynb">online appendix</a> describes the methods associated with the observational study and experiment. On a conceptual level we investigate the effect of hiding like counts on Instagram on users' posting frequency (H1), variety of visual-content (H2), like behavior (H3), and self-esteem (H4).</p>

## Data Description
This research project builds on an observational data set scraped from Instagram (July 2020) and an experimental dataset obtained through a questionnaire on Prolific (N=600). Preprocessing of the raw data is documented in a step-by-step fashion in the appendix. Definitions and descriptions are outlined over <a href="https://github.com/RoyKlaasseBos/Hiding-Instagram-Likes/blob/master/Data_Set_Description.ipynb">here</a>. All data can be accessed through a relational database service. Attached online appendix refers to multiple environment variables in order to connect to the database. Credentials can be acquired by contacting one of the authors.
