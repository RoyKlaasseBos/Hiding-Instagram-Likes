    "<p><i>Likes are widely available on social network services and are known to influence people’s self-image. An emerging literature has started to look at potential detrimental effects of social media use among teenagers. We study how Instagram users’ posting frequency, variety, like behavior, and relative self-esteem are affected by an intervention in which like counts were hidden in selected treatment countries. Using a unique panel data set of individual users’ Instagram posts across multiple years, we find evidence that users posted more frequently and more varied than in the months prior to the intervention. On the other hand, the number of likes decreases as people are no longer influenced by others’ evaluations, especially among users with a small following. Further, in an experiment we show that the number of likes people see on others’ posts affects their relative self-esteem, and that users are more likely to self-disclose once they rate themselves more positively. These results are critical to understanding the dynamics on visual-based social media in order to foster a healthy online environment.</i></p>\n",
