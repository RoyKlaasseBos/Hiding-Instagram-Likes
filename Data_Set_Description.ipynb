    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Composition of dataset \n",
    "The dataset provides a list of 111960 historical posts from 316 Instagram users. The `consumers_psm` table can be used to select usernames included in the matched sample. Image content associated with these posts have been analyzed with Azure Vision API to compute image-similarity within and between-subjects. All data have been normalized and separated into various schemas, whose variable operationalisations we describe next.\n",

    "#### 3. Collection Process\n",
    "The data was collected in July 2020 and consists of posts ranging between 2011 and 2020 (depending on when users joined Instagram). We used an [external library](https://github.com/arc298/instagram-scraper) to scrape posts from selected Instagram accounts. Our start seed of influencer accounts was obtained in February 2020 from [HypeAuditor](https://hypeauditor.com/top-instagram/). The dataset only comprises data of users whose Instagram account is public (no private data). Furthermore, image content data was obtained through [Azure Computer Vision API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Preprocessing\n",
    "A detailed description of the preprocessing of raw JSON data can be found over [here](https://github.com/RoyKlaasseBos/Hiding-Instagram-Likes/blob/master/Web_Appendix_Hiding_Like_Counts_Instagram.ipynb). The data has been cleaned using a combination of Python and R.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Uses\n",
    "The dataset has been used to study the effect of hiding like counts on user behavior and self-esteem. To this end, the data consists of observational data before and after the intervention. Other use cases for the dataset are natural language processing and object recognition (deep learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Distribution\n",
    "The repository containing all code is publicly available on Github. Raw and preprocessed data is stored in a cloud database. Anonymized data may be requested for academic purposes only.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Maintenance\n",
    "The dataset is stored on Amazon Web Services (RDS) and backed-up daily."
