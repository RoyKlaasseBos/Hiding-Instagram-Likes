    "This data has been scraped from Instagram in July 2020. Specifically, it provides a list of 111960 historical posts from 316 Instagram users. Image content associated with these posts have been analyzed with Azure Vision API to compute image-similarity within and between-subjects. All data have been normalized and separated into various schemas, whose variable operationalisations we describe next."
